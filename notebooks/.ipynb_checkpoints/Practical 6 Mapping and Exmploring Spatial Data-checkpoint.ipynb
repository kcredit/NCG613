This scheme defines class boundaries as some distance from the attribute mean in terms of multiples of the standard deviation of the attribute. For the default $k$ = 5, the common definition is to set the upper and lower bins as two standard deviations above and below the mean (respectively), while the fourth and second bins are set to within one standard deviation of the attribute, and the middle bin straddles the attribute mean. Any values larger or smaller than two standard deviations from the mean are placed into the upper and lower bins (respectively)."

For example, the largest value in the lowest quintile would be considered for movement into the second quintile, while the lowest value in the second quintile would be considered for a possible move into the first quintile. The candidate move resulting in the largest reduction in the objective function would be made, and the process continues until no other improving moves are possible."

    "## Colour Theory\n",
    "As mentioned above, choropleth maps rely on changing colour *shade* (brightness/darkness) and *hue* (colour) in order to differentiate quantitative data values. They make an intuitive connection between changes in shade/hue and changes in data values, which makes them extremely useful as data visualizations. However, before choosing a colour palette to display your data, it's important to understand the limitations to this connection. First, as we discussed above, different classification schemes will produce (sometimes vastly) different patterns of colour for the same underlying data values. Often times classification schemes bunch the impression of the distribution of values so that the largest and smallest outliers appear smaller and larger (respectively) than they actually are, because they are grouped in the same colour as neighbouring, but potentially much less extreme, values. This is a particular problem for right-skewed attributes common in urban and economic analysis. Second, the size, shape, and arrangement of areal units is rarely uniform, which influences the implicit connection in the viewer's mind between value and colour - a very large areal unit dominates the visual field and likely skews the perception of the distribution of data values by presenting a mass of one colour (even though it only counts as one observation). Third, extremely small changes in shade are difficult for the human brain to perceive, which can pose difficulties for single-hue colour palettes with a large number of bins. Fourth, colours on a map have implicit subjective associations (e.g., red = \"bad\" or \"negative\", while blue = \"good\" or \"positive\"); these implicit associations may differ by discipline or use case.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the most important point to remember is that the purpose of a choropleth map is to match the *numeric* distance between classes using the *visual* \"distance\" between colour hue/shade attached to each class *in the mind of the viewer*. This is ultimately a somewhat subjective process that involves iteration and an intuitive feel for the distribution of colours on a map. The default palette in ```geopandas``` (and ```matplotlib```) is 'viridis', a multi-hue sequential scheme that moves from dark blue to light yellow. Virdis was designed scientifically to cross the largest range of perceptible colour values in order to maximize visual clarity between class breaks (while still retaining some intuitive sense of \"direction\")."

    "### Sequential Colour Schemes\n",
    "Data attributes that have a sequential nature - e.g., starting at 0 and progressing numerically - should generally be displayed using a sequential colour scheme. Viridis is an example of a multi-hue sequential colour scheme, because the colours move through hues from a \"darker\" hue/value (blue) to a \"lighter\" hue/value (yellow). Sometimes, we may prefer a single-hue sequential scheme that moves though *shades* of one colour from a \"lighter\" shade/value (white) to a \"darker\" shade/value of a single hue (e.g., red). The [documentation](https://matplotlib.org/2.0.2/users/colormaps.html) for ```matplotlib``` contains a very instructive description and display of relevant sequential colour palettes that can be used.![image.png](attachment:image.png)"

    "### Diverging Colour Schemes\n",
    "Sometimes your attribute value has a natural mid-point that is important to highlight positive and negative movement around, e.g., 0, a national average, or the value in a previous year. In these cases, it is appropriate to use a diverging colour scheme that use two different sequential palettes for values above and below the attribute's mid-point. Often times a red-blue diverging palette is used to indicate negative values (reds) and positive values (blue), with values near zero appearing in white, but there are a variety of choices available. Diverging schemes are generally well-paired with mean-standard deviation classification schemes, because they are inherently designed to split values in terms of standard deviations above or below the attribute mean."

    "### Qualitative Colour Schemes\n",
    "Qualitative or categorical variables (such as names, regions, or other types of classifications) can also be displayed on maps. In this case, the objective is to explicitly __not__ make any association between colour and data value movement, because categorical attributes have no inherent numeric properties. At the same time, of course, you want to choose a colour palette that is visually appealing. In the London boroughs dataset, the 'ONS_INNER' variable is a categorical marker delineating boroughs that are considered a part of \"Inner London\" vs. \"Outer London\":"

    "## Considerations for Areal Data\n",
    "Now that we have the basics of choropleth map-making down, we can turn to examining some of the most important underlying considerations for areal data that influence the veracity of analyses and visualizations created using aggregated areal data. Since we are using a variable that we created ourselves by aggregating house points to boroughs, we can play with the underlying properties in order to see how different aggregation choices - many of which are typically invisible to you as an end data user - change the resulting visual representation (and thus insights gained about the data and underlying process it represents).\n",
    "### Standardization\n",
    "Let's start with a fairly common situation - you've downloaded some data which is presented in the form of aggregated counts by areal unit - in this case, we'll use our aggregated 'House_Count' by London borough. If you display this variable in its raw form, without accounting for the underlying size of the borough, your result looks like this:"

However, since we do have the individual aggregated counts in this case we can assess  representativeness using a population-based weighting scheme typical in the social sciences. The basic logic is to find each borough's proportion of total population (the \"target\" value) and then divide that  (for each borough) by the borough's proportion of house points (the \"sample\" value) (a good discussion of this methodology, often used in sample surveys, can be found here: [Weighting of responses in the Consumer Survey:\n",

The resulting 'House_Weight' is a measure that represents the under- or over-representation of house points in the sample in each borough compared to the underlying distribution of population in each borough.

    "1. Map the variables 'Unemp', 'Disabled', 'NonEng', and 'CrimeRate' using each of the four classification schemes shown here. Change $k$, explore new color palettes, and evaluate which classification scheme/colour palette combination performs best.  \n",
    "2. Once you have a good classification scheme for each, compare the distribution of these four variables and look at relationships to one another and to median income, average price per square metre, and green space density - what insights can you draw about the relationship between these variables? Do these relationships confirm or contradict your personal, anecdotal hypotheses?"
