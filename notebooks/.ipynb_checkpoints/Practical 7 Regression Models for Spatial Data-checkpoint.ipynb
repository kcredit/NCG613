    "This notebook investigates the use of regression methods using ```spreg``` to analyse housing prices in a hedonic framework. I have prepared a range of data for this practical (in order to save significant amounts of computation time), including a few demographic variables at the Output Area (small area) Census geography and several spatial features involving distance (in metres) from housing points to various urban features of interest, including __primary roads__, __transit stations__, and __open space__. In general, the [London Datastore](https://data.london.gov.uk/) is a good place to find spatial data on various urban features, and UK Census data can be accessed easily through [NOMIS](https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/). \n",

    "## Non-spatial Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression\n",
    "Before we dive into regression specifics, let's take a look at the big picture: why do we use regression models to answer social science questions in the first place? A multiple regression is an extension of classic equation of a line $y = mx + b$ for more than one independent variable in which the best-fit line is calculated for the dependent variable (predicted values) based on the associated values of all the covariates (independent variables). The OLS function solves this equation (in multi-dimensional space) by minimizing the squared distance between the predicted and observed values of $Y$ (i.e., 'residuals'). Because the linear model is additive, we can interpret each individual slope coefficient $\\beta_{k}$ on the best-fit line as the (partial) correlation between the explanatory variable $k$ and the dependent variable $Y$, *holding all other explanatory variables constant*. From [Rey et al. (2020)](https://geographicdata.science/book/notebooks/11_regression.html#spatial-feature-engineering):\n",
    ">When one calculates bivariate correlations, the coefficient of a variable is picking up the correlation between the variables, but it is also subsuming into it variation associated with other correlated variables – also called confounding factors. Regression allows us to isolate the distinct effect that a single variable has on the dependent one, once we control for those other variables\n",
    "\n",
    "This feature - combined with the fact that we can test the significance of each coefficient using a $p$-value (with the assumptions that the residuals of the model are normally-distributed and have constant variance) - makes the linear regression an incredibly powerful tool for assessing explanatory relationships between variables in the social (and other) sciences. While it is now incredibly easy to calculate linear regressions on the fly in many statistical software packages, it is valuable to appreciate the theoretical mathematical work that has gone in to creating this useful statistical tool. However, it is also important to understand that the linear model has limitations and is only unbiased within a set of somewhat-limited assumptions, which we'll explore here.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hedonic Modelling\n",
    "This practical demonstrates the explanatory regression framework by using the example of a hedonic regression model. Hedonic models are used to explain the effect of various characteristics on urban housing values. With the unit of analysis at the house (point) level, the basic specification of the Hedonic model is: \n",
    "\n",
    "$Y = X_{1}\\beta_{1} + X_{2}\\beta_{2} + \\upsilon$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $Y$ is the (log-transformed) price, $X_{1}$ is a vector of housing characteristics (e.g., size, age, number of rooms, etc.),  $X_{2}$ is a vector of neighbourhood and urban characteristics (e.g., distance to the city centre, distance to the nearest transit station, etc.), and $\\upsilon$ is the error term (or constant). The first term of this equation is pretty straightforward - the basic assumption is that the price of a house is going to be significantly related to how large it is, and generally what kind of house it is. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can test this assumption by running a non-spatial regression between price and various housing characteristics. First, let's pull up the table so that we can see what the variables are called:"

    "On the top we have some indicators of model fit, including the R-squared, which tells us the % of overall variance in $Y$ explained by the covariates that we included in this model. 0.1605 is about what we would expect given that we do not have very much information on the characteristics of each *house* - only a rough estimate of the floor area (based on dwelling type). Given that, it is fairly impressive that we have explained about a sixth of the total variance in housing prices just by including information on the size of the house and distance to a few urban amenities. Adjusted R-squared discounts the raw R-squared by taking into account the number of variables (because models with more covariates tend to have higher R-squareds simply as a by-product of having more information included to make a prediction), and is generally the one to use when evaluating models. We can also see the number of observations ($N$) and degrees of freedom (values that are free to vary in the calculation of the model, i.e., if you have as many independent variables as observations, your model estimates will be biased).\n",
    "### Summary of Output: Middle Section\n",
    "Next we can look at the coefficient values, which are the slopes of the regression line that the model calculated for each of the covariates that we included. As a note: the [UCLA Institute for Digital Research and Education (IDRE)](https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/other/mult-pkg/faq/general/faqhow-do-i-interpret-a-regression-model-when-some-variables-are-log-transformed/) has a lot of great guides for understanding basic parameters of statistical models, so feel free to read through (or search for) articles related to understanding the basics of regression models. Since our dependent variable is logged, the coefficients of this model can be a little difficult to interpret. For a typical continuous variable in any regression model - like 'Dist_Transit' - the coefficient can be interpreted as the change (positive or negative) in the *dependent variable* expected based on a one-unit change in the independent variable. However, since our dependent variable is logged, the interpretation changes a bit: first we have to exponentiate the coefficient (i.e., take the inverse of the natural log); this value (centred on 1) is the *percent change in the geometric mean* of the dependent variable that we would expect form a one-unit increase in the independent variable. Subtracting 1 from the exponentiated coefficient helps our interpretation. Let's look at the 'Dist_Transit' example:"

    "The idea is to provide a number associated with how confident we are that this coefficient value is different than 0. If the coefficient is very large but the error around the estimate is also large (i.e., we have a large estimate but it varies a lot from case to case), then we will have low confidence that the predicted coefficient is different than 0 (thus a low $t$-value). In that way, the significance of your coefficient estimate is a function of 1) actual effect of the independent variable, 2) variation in the relationship of the independent variable to the dependent variable, and 3) the sample size. A large $t$-value corresponds to a small probability ($p$-value) that the coefficient is equal to 0 (the null hypothesis); basically, the $p$-value is a comparison the $t$-value to the [*Student's t distribution*](https://www.itl.nist.gov/div898/handbook/eda/section3/eda3672.htm) to determine what % of values are \"more extreme\" than the estimated $t$-value. This varies by degrees of freedom in the model - with three degrees of freedom, a $t$-value of 10.215 is more extreme that 0.999% of values in the distribution (and thus would have a corresponding $p$-value of .001); but as degrees of freedom (i.e., sample size) increase, $t$-value threshold for given critical values also decreases. With large samples, $t$-values of 2.326 are more extreme than 0.99% of values in the Student's $t$ distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "OK, so what does it all mean? Generally you want to set a critical $p$-value for rejecting/not rejecting the null hypothesis before you run your regression - the most common value is 0.05, but there are good reasons to select higher or lower values, depending on your data (critically, on your sample size). The $p$-value, then, is an estimate of the probability that the model's regression coefficient is not actually different than 0. If it is below the set threshold, we talk about the coefficient being a \"statistically-significant\" predictor of $Y$, but there are again good reasons to take $p$-values with a grain of salt and use more nuanced terms such as \"interesting\" values, or to discuss \"high confidence\" that the result is significant, etc. In our case - in this specification, at least - every variable seems to be highly-significant for predicting variation in housing price.\n",

    "Finally, at the bottom of the report we have the results of several diagnostic tests. The ```MULTICOLLINEARITY CONDITION NUMBER``` is a test of the collinearity between covariates - generally 51.846 is quite a high value, but this is also to be expected based on the framework of the hedonic model (distance to transit will tend to be highly-correlated with distance to roads, for instance). While [multicollinearity](https://statisticsbyjim.com/regression/multicollinearity-in-regression-analysis/) in the predictors can bias the coefficient estimates, cause swings in positive/negative signs, and create significant difficulties in interpretation (if two variables are almost entirely correlated, what does it mean for one coefficient to represent variation in $Y$ *holding constant* almost all of its own variation that is embodied in the other collinear variable?), the problem also has to be weighed against ommitted variable bias, which occurs when important predictors of $Y$ are left out of the model entirely. In our case, given the well-established nature of the hedonic model, we will sit tight with our multicollinearity condition value and observe if it swings up wildly from here with additional covariates. The ```Jarque-Bera``` statistics provides a test on the normality of errors of our model - in this case it is significant, meaning that the errors are significantly *not* normally-distributed. Since we have already logged a few of our variables to provide a more linear fit, the next step is to include additional factors - including spatial variables - that might improve the normality of the model errors. And finally, the ```Breusch-Pagan``` and ```Koenker-Bassett``` statistics test for heteroskedasticity. Again, in this case, both are significant, which indicates that the use of the ```robust='white'``` parameter in the ```spreg``` call to use White's robust standard errors is justified. While these values remain significant, unfortunately ```spreg``` does not include additional options for standard error correction, and we will have to be content with watching the value of these test statistics themselves increase or decrease with future specifications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Spatial Structure\n",
    "One way to interrogate these model diagnostics - and particularly the non-normality of the errors - further is to try to understand if spatial structure is playing a hidden role in determining variation in $Y$. In our current specification, we haven't included any information about neighbourhood or any of the contextual urban factors that play a significant role in determining property values (a beautiful, new, gigantic mansion located next to an industrial site that pollutes the air will not be worth the same as it would be in a quiet residential neighbourhood).\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to examine this (and to help explain the non-normality of the model errors) is to look at clustering in the model errors by neighbourhood. To do this, let's spatially join the 2023 housing points to the Output Areas (in which I have embedded the name of the borough that each Output Area is located within):"

These fixed effects then control for all of the unobserved variation (outside of the other covariates) associated with each borough, and can be a very useful way to observe heterogeneity in relationships across space. We'll also add in a few additional explanatory variables - 'DEPRHH' (% households with at least one deprivation indicator) and 'PROFSCI' (% employed in professional and scientific industries).

    "### Spatial Lag Model (SAR)\n",
    "The spatial lag model is used in cases where we assume there is spatial dependence or *contagion* in the *dependent* variable; in other words, cases where one unit's values are directly spilling-over to influence neighbouring units. The specification of the spatial lag model generally is:\n",

    "$Y = WY\\rho + X\\beta + \\epsilon$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $W$ is the spatial weights matrix and $\\rho$ is the spatial lag coefficient. In this case, we could interpret the spatial spillover process as some sort of social contagion where people set their house prices explicitly based on the prices of neighbouring prices. In terms of mathematical estimation, it is probably obvious that the $Y$ term on both sides of the equation violates the exogeneity assumption of OLS. There are various ways to estimate this equation (including Maximum Likelihood) available in ```PySAL```, but here we'll use the [General Method of Moments (GMM)](https://spatial.uchicago.edu/sites/spatial.uchicago.edu/files/12_gmm_slides.pdf) technique of Anselin (1988) which handles this endogeneity using a Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS) approach, using the spatial lag of all explanatory variables as instruments for the endogenous lag variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although a bit of an aside, it is  important to note that the coefficients from spatial lag-type models cannot be directly interpreted ([LeSage and Pace, 2009, p. 34](https://maynoothuniversity-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/kevin_credit_mu_ie/ERorbeUoPJJIsHUlDhYVDdIBTtdC_AKU-M9O3V4WUClbJw?e=0gEKCM)). Basically, when the spatial lag of $Y$ is included on the right-hand side of the equation, a change in the value of an independent variable in a given observation can potentially influence the the value of dependent variable in all other observations (i.e., a \"global spillover\") because the model takes into account other observations' dependent variable values through $WY$. From pp. 35-36: \"this impact includes the effect of feedback loops where observation $i$ affects observation $j$ and observation $j$ also affects observation $i$ as well as longer paths which might go from observation $i$ to $j$ to $k$ and back to $i$.\" In order to correctly deal with this complexity, scalar summary measures calculated by taking the partial derivatives of the expected values of $y$ with respect to the explanatory variables are used to estimate the average direct and indirect effects. Thus, in the SAR model (and its extensions, such as the spatial Durbin), the true direct and indirect effects are not directly available in the same way that they are in the SLX model. At this point, to my knowledge, `Python` does not yet contain a method for calculating these scalar summary measures for SAR models. However, for our purposes, it is useful enough to understand that the raw regression coefficients of the SAR model encompass both these direct and indirect effects."

    "### Spatial Durbin Model (SDM)\n",
    "We can also combine the SAR and SLX specifications to create the spatial 'Durbin' (SDM) model: $Y = WY\\rho + X\\beta + WX\\gamma + \\epsilon$. Now, the GMM estimation for the SAR model that we used here incorporates spatial lags of the explanatory variables in a Two-Stage Least Squares (2SLS) design. This means that a true spatial Durbin-type model is not exactly possible to create with the type of GMM model specified in `m6` (e.g.) above, because the spatial lags of $X$ are already being used in the estimation of the model. `PySAL` offers a maximum-likelihood (ML) estimation method for SAR models, `spreg.ML_Lag()`, which should be employed if estimating a true spatial Durbin. Unfortunately, the computation time for the ML SAR model in Python is currently extremely long, so we have opted for a functional workaround: calculating the spatial lag of $Y$ manually and directly inserting it into the right-hand side of the equation, to be estimated by `statsmodels`. Using statsmodels also allows us to include borough (or other) fixed effects in the model if we would like. I should also note that R has a robust spatial econometrics offerings (in the `spatialreg` and `sphet` packages, among [others](https://r-spatial.org/book/17-Econometrics.html)) that would allow you to estimate spatial Durbin (and all other spatial) models directly."

It seems likely that the portion of variance in house prices that neighbouring house size ('w_log_area') explains *after controlling for* neighbouring house prices is relatively small, but these results suggest that, all things being equal, your house price tends to be larger when your neighbours' houses are smaller and more expensive, which may make some sense.

Alternatively, distance to nearest primary road is a house price *benefit* in Bromley - where many of the residents likely rely on cars for transportation - and insignificant in walkable, urban Camden. A similar relationship holds for distance to open space, which may reflect the general features of housing demand in each borough (e.g., people may value open space in Camen but it is not the primary feature driving valuable property). Local demographics are generally important to house prices in both boroughs, particularly for deprivation, as is general distance to the centre of London (which structures housing prices generally throughout the region). And finally, the spatial lags in Camden appear to follow the pooled model results, and are not significant in Bromley. This is interesting, as the R-squared for Bromley is also higher in general than the pooled model (.506) - perhaps this reflects the fact that, in Bromley, the specified variables explain most of the spatial variation in house prices (better than in other boroughs).\n",
